=head1 NAME

Archive::Tar::Merge - Merge two or more tarballs into one

=head1 SYNOPSIS

    use Archive::Tar::Merge;

    my $merger = Archive::Tar::Merge->new(
        source_tarballs => ["a.tgz", "b.tgz"],
        dest_tarball    => "c.tgz"
    );

    $merger->merge();

=head1 DESCRIPTION

C<Archive::Tar::Merge> takes two or more tarballs, merges their files
and writes the resulting directory/file structure out to a destination
tarball.

In the easiest case, there's no overlap between files. Then
the result is just a union of all files in all source tarballs.

If there's overlap, but the overlapping files are identical in the source
and destination tarballs, there's no conflict and C<Archive::Tar::Merge>
just puts the files into the destination tarball without further ado.

=head2 Deciders

If there is a conflict, e.g. two files under the same path in two source
tarballs which have different content or permissions, a decision needs
to be made which of the source files is going to be used in the destination
tarball. The C<decider> parameter takes a reference to a function, which 
receives both the logical path and the physical locations of the two
(or more) conflicting files. Based on this, it decides what to do:

=over 4

=item *

Return the array index of the winning file. If the decider gets a
reference to an array of 2 source tarballs, returning

    return { index => 0 }

will pick the first file while

    return { index => 1 }

will pick the second one.

=item *

Return the content of the winning file. How it comes up with this content
is up to the decider, typically, it applies
a filter to one or more of the source files, derives the content of the
destination file from them and returns its content as a string.

    return { content => "content of destination file" }

=item *

Ignore the file. Leave it out of the destination tarball:

    return { action => "ignore" };

=back

As parameters, the decider receives the file's logical source path in the
tarball and a list of paths to the unpacked source file candidates. Here's an
example of a decider that resolves conflicts by prioritizing files from
the second source tarball (C<b.tgz>):

    my $merger = Archive::Tar::Merge->new(
        source_tarballs => ["a.tgz", "b.tgz"],
        dest_tarball    => "c.tgz"
        decider         => \&decider,
    );

      # If there's a conflict, let the source file of the
      # last candidate win.
    sub decider {
        my($logical_src_path, $candidate_physical_paths) = @_;
          
          # Always return the index of the last candidate
        return { index => $candidate_pysical_paths->[-1] };
    }

    $merger->merge();

If a decider wants to make a decision based on the content of one or 
more of the source files, it has to open and read them. A somewhat
contrived example would be a decider which appends the content of all
conflicting source files and adds them under the given logical path
to the destination tarball:

    use File::Slurp;

    sub decider {
        my($logical_src_path, $candidate_physical_paths) = @_;
          
        my $content;

        for my $path (@$candidate_physical_paths) {
            $content .= read_file($path);
        }

        return { content => $content };
    }

A decider receives a reference to the outgoing C<Archive::Tar::Wrapper>
object as a third parameter:

    sub decider {
        my($logical_src_path, $candidate_physical_paths, $out_tar) = @_;

This allows for adding extra files to the outgoing tarball and 
perform all kinds of scary manipulations.

=head2 Hooks

Sometimes not all of the source files are supposed to be merged to the
destination. A hook, called with the logical source path and a list of 
source file candidate physical paths, can act as a filter to suppress files,
modify their content, or store them under a different location.

    my $merger = Archive::Tar::Merge->new(
        source_tarballs => ["a.tgz", "b.tgz"],
        dest_tarball    => "c.tgz"
        hook            => \&hook,
    );

      # Keep only "bin/*" files
    sub hook {
        my($logical_src_path, $candidate_paths) = @_;
          
        if($logical_src_path =~ /^bin/) {
              # keep
            return undef;
        }

        return { action => "ignore" };
    }

Just like deciders, hooks receive the file's logical source path in the
tarball and a reference to an array of paths to the source file candidates.
Hooks I<differ> from deciders in that they are called with I<every> file
that is merged and not just with conflicting files.

If a merger defines both a decider and a hook, in case of a conflict,
it will <only> call the decider. It doesn't make sense to call the hook
in this case because the decider already had the opportunity to totally
render the content of the file itself, making things like source paths 
useless.

If a hook returns C<undef>, the file will be kept unmodified. On

        return { action => "ignore" };

the file will be ignored. And a hook can, just like a decider, filter
the original file or create its content from scratch by using the
C<content> parameter.

A hook also receives a reference to the outgoing C<Archive::Tar::Wrapper>
object.

=head2 Using a decider to add multiple files

If you have two tarballs which both have a different version of the
C<path/to/file>, you might want to add these entries as 
C<path/to/file.1> and C<path/to/file.2> to the outgoing tarball.

Since the decider gets a reference to the outgoing tarball's 
C<Archive::Tar::Wrapper> object, you can easily do that:

    my $merger = Archive::Tar::Merge->new(
        source_tarballs => ["a.tgz", "b.tgz"],
        decider => sub {
          my($logical_src_path, $candidate_physical_paths, $out_tar) = @_;
          
          my $idx = 1;
          for my $ppath (@$candidate_physical_paths) {
            $out_tar->add($logical_src_path . ".$idx", $ppath);
            $idx++;
          }

          return { action => "ignore" };
        }
    );

Note that the decider code not only adds the different versions under
different paths to the outgoing tarball but also tells the main 
C<Archive::Tar::Merge> code to ignore the file to prevent it from adding
yet another version.

=head2 Post-processing the outgoing tarball

If the C<Archive::Tar::Merge> object gets the name of the outgoing
tarball in its constructor call, its C<merge()> method will write the 
outgoing tarball into the file specified right after the merge process
has been completed.

If C<dest_tarball> isn't specified, as in

    my $merger = Archive::Tar::Merge->new(
        source_tarballs => ["a.tgz", "b.tgz"],
    );

then writing out the resulting tarball can be done manually by 
using the C<Archive::Tar::Wrapper> object returned by C<merge()>:

     my $out_tar = $merger->merge();
     $out_tar->write("c.tgz", $compressed);

For more info on what to do with the C<Archive::Tar::Wrapper> object,
read its documentation.
